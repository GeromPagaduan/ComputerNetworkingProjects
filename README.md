# ComputerNetworkingProjects

This repository contains three separate college projects. Using Java, each one emulates a different type of protocol:


- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), also uses Djikstra's algorithm.

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)


Each project has a testResultsClient.txt file, which shows the output of each project.
